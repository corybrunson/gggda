\title{A unified ordination object class}
\usage{
as_tbl_ord(x)

\method{as_tbl_ord}{tbl_ord}(x)

make_tbl_ord(rows = NULL, cols = NULL, ...)

is_tbl_ord(x)

is.tbl_ord(x)

valid_tbl_ord(x)

un_tbl_ord(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An ordination object.}

\item{rows, cols}{Matrices to be used as factors of a tbl_ord.}

\item{...}{Additional elements of a custom tbl_ord.}
}
\description{
These functions wrap ordination objects in the class \link{tbl_ord},
create tbl_ords directly from matrices, and test for the class and basic
structure.
}
\details{
The tbl_ord class wraps around a range of ordination classes, making
available a suite of ordination tools that specialize to each original object
class. These tools include \code{\link[=format]{format()}} and \code{\link[=fortify]{fortify()}} methods, which
facilitate the \code{\link[=print]{print()}} method and the \code{\link[=ggbiplot]{ggbiplot()}} function.

No default method is provided for \code{as_tbl_ord()}, despite most defined
methods being equivalent (simply appending tbl_ord to the vector of object
classes). This prevents objects for which other methods are not defined from
being re-classed as tbl_ords.

The function \code{make_tbl_ord()} creates a tbl_ord structured as a list of two
matrices, \code{u} and \code{v}, which must have the same number of columns and the
same column names.

\code{is_tbl_ord()} checks an object \code{x} for the tbl_ord class; \code{valid_tbl_ord()}
additionally checks for consistency between \code{recover_coord(x)} and the
columns of \code{recover_rows(x)} and \code{recover_cols(x)}, using the \link{accessors}.
\code{un_tbl_ord()} removes attributes associated with the tbl_ord class in order
to restore an object that was originally passed to \code{as_tbl_ord}.
