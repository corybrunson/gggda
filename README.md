# ordr

**ordr** integrates ordination analysis and biplot visualization into
[**tidyverse**](https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyverse) workflows.

## motivation

### ordination and biplots

*Ordination* is a catch-all term for a variety of statistical techniques
that introduce an artificial coordinate system for a data set in such a
way that a few coordinates capture a large amount of the data structure
\[1\]. The branch of mathematical statistics called [geometric data
analysis](https://www.springer.com/us/book/9781402022357) (GDA) provides
the theoretical basis for (most of) these techniques. Ordination
overlaps with regression and with dimension reduction, which can be
[contrasted to clustering and
classification](https://towardsdatascience.com/supervised-vs-unsupervised-learning-14f68e32ea8d)
in that they assign continuous rather than discrete values to data
elements \[2\].

Most ordination techniques decompose a numeric rectangular data set into
the product of two matrices, often using singular value decomposition.
The coordinates of the shared dimensions of these matrices (over which
they are multiplied) are the artificial coordinates. In some cases, such
as principal components analysis, the decomposition is exact; in others,
such as non-negative matrix factorization, it is approximate. Some
techniques, such as correspondence analysis, transform the data before
decomposition. Ordination techniques may be supervised, like linear
discriminant analysis, or unsupervised, like multidimensional scaling.

Analysis pipelines that use these techniques may use the artificial
coordinates directly, in place of natural coordinates, to arrange and
compare data elements or to predict responses. This is possible because
both the rows and the columns of the original table can be located, or
positioned, along these shared coordinates. The number of artificial
coordinates used in an application, such as regression or visualization,
is called the *rank* of the ordination \[3\]. A common application is
the *biplot*, which positions the rows and columns of the original table
in a scatterplot in 1, 2, or 3 artificial coordinates, usually those
that explain the most variation in the data.

### implementations in R

An extensive range of ordination techniques are implemented in R, from
classical multidimensional scaling (`stats::cmdscale()`) and principal
components analysis (`stats::prcomp()` and `stats::princomp()`) in the
**stats** package distributed with base R, across widely-used
implementations of linear discriminant analysis (`MASS::lda()`) and
correspondence analysis (`ca::ca()`) in general-use statistical
packages, to highly specialized packages that implement cutting-edge
techniques or adapt conventional techniques to challenging settings.
These implementations come with their own conventions, tailored to the
research communities that produced them, and it would be impractical
(and probably unhelpful) to try to consolidate them.

Instead, **ordr** provides a streamlined process by which the models
output by these methods—in particular, the matrix factors into which the
original data are approximately decomposed and the artificial
coordinates they share—can be inspected, annotated, tabulated,
summarized, and visualized. On this last point, most biplot
implementations in R provide limited customizability. **ordr** adopts
the grammar of graphics paradigm from **ggplot2** to modularize and
standardize biplot elements \[4\]. Overall, the package is designed to
follow the broader syntactic conventions of the **tidyverse**, so that
users familiar with a this workflow can more easily and quickly
integrate ordination models into practice.

## usage

### installation

**ordr** remains under development and is not scheduled for a CRAN
release. For now, it can be installed from the (default) `main` branch
using [**remotes**](https://github.com/r-lib/remotes):

``` r
remotes::install_github("corybrunson/ordr")
```

### PCA example

Principal components analysis (PCA) is by far the most widely-used
ordination technique. This example performs an uncentered PCA on a small
data set of personal expenditures over twenty years and represents the
data in a symmetric biplot. At each step the result is printed, so that
the user can see the effect of each step on the `prcomp` object.

### MDS example

Multidimensional scaling (MDS) is an ordination technique that starts
not with rectangular data but with interpoint distances. A common
illustration of its power is to calculate MDS on the set of
distances—however measured—between geographic locations, and to
recover the approximate geography via a biplot. This example is adapted
from the documentation of `cmdscale()` in the **stats** package; note
that **ordr** provides the wrapper `cmdscale_ord()` that always returns
the eigenvalues and the symmetric distance matrix produced during the
calculation. The MDS uses 11 coordinates—the number of positive
eigenvalues—so that `stat_*_spantree()` can call upon them to recover
the intercity
distances.

``` r
# `tbl_ord` object for a classical MDS on distances between European cities
eurodist %>%
  cmdscale_ord(k = 11) %>%
  as_tbl_ord() %>%
  augment_ord() %>%
  print() -> city_mds
#> # A tbl_ord of class 'cmds_ord': (21 x 11) x (21 x 11)'

Any feedback on the package is very welcome\! If you encounter confusion
or errors, do create an issue, with a [minimal reproducible

### inspiration

This package was originally inspired by the **ggbiplot** extension
developed by [Vincent Q. Vu](https://github.com/vqv/ggbiplot), [Richard
J Telford](https://github.com/richardjtelford/ggbiplot), and [Vilmantas
Gegzna](https://github.com/GegznaV/ggbiplot), among others. So far as i
know, it first brought biplots into the **tidyverse** framework. The
motivation to unify a variety of ordination methods came from [several
books and
articles](https://www.barcelonagse.eu/research/publications/all?author=Michael%20Greenacre)
by Michael Greenacre, in particular [*Biplots in
Practice*](https://www.fbbva.es/microsite/multivariate-statistics/resources.html#biplots).
Thomas Lin Pedersen’s
[**tidygraph**](https://github.com/thomasp85/tidygraph) prequel to
**ggraph** finally induced the shift from the downstream generation of
scatterplots to the upstream handling and manipulating of ordination
models. Additional design elements and features have been informed by
the monograph
[*Biplots*](https://www.routledge.com/Biplots/Gower-Hand/p/book/9780412716300)
and the textbook [*Understanding
Biplots*](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Understanding+Biplots-p-9780470012550)
by John C. Gower, David J. Hand, Sugnet Gardner Lubbe, and Niel J. Le
Roux.

## notes

1.  The term *ordination* is most prevalent among ecologists; to my
    knowledge, no catch-all term is in common use outside ecology.

2.  This is not a hard rule: PCA is often used to compress data before
    clustering, and LDA uses dimension reduction to perform
    classification tasks.

3.  Regression and clustering models, like classical [linear
    regression](http://www.multivariatestatistics.org/chapter2.html) and
    [*k*-means](http://joelcadwell.blogspot.com/2015/08/matrix-factorization-comes-in-many.html),
    can also be understood as matrix decomposition approximations and
    even visualized in biplots. Their shared coordinates, which are
    pre-defined rather than artificial, are the predictor coefficients
    and the cluster assignments, respectively. Methods for `stats::lm()`
    and `stats::kmeans()`, for example, are implemented for the sake of
    novelty and instruction, but are not widely used in practice.

4.  Biplot elments must be chosen with care, and it is useful and
    appropriate that many model-specific biplot methods have limited
    flexibility. This package adopts the trade-off articulated in
    [Wilkinson’s *The Grammar of
    Graphics*](https://www.google.com/books/edition/_/iI1kcgAACAAJ)
    (p. 15): “This system is capable of producing some hideous
    graphics. There is nothing in its design to prevent its misuse. …
    This system cannot produce a meaningless graphic, however.”
